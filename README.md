## AutoFoldCode
A Sublime Text package that saves/restores folded code regions in files automatically.

This plugin makes folded code regions persist - whether you're just opening/closing a file, starting/quitting Sublime Text or rebooting your computer, AutoFoldCode will restore your folded code with no hassle.

Thank you for checking this out, if you want to support what I do you might [buy me a coffe](https://ko-fi.com/ridetoday)!

## Installation
1. Open the Command Palette, and find `Package Control: Install Package`.
2. Search for `AutoFoldCode` and install.

## Usage
Once installed, AutoFoldCode will automatically begin persisting code folds.

AutoFoldCode also includes some useful commands:

* `AutoFoldCode: Clear All`
	- This command will clear AutoFoldCode's cache.
* `AutoFoldCode: Clear Current File`
	- This command will remove the current file's folded regions from the cache, and unfold all folded regions in the file.
