## AutoFoldCode
A Sublime Text package that saves/restores folded code regions in files automatically.

This plugin makes folded code regions persist - whether you're just opening/closing a file, starting/quitting Sublime Text or rebooting your computer, AutoFoldCode will restore your folded code with no hassle.

Thank you for checking this out, if you want to support what I do you might [buy me a coffe](https://ko-fi.com/ridetoday)!

## Installation
1. Open the Command Palette, and find `Package Control: Install Package`.
2. Search for `AutoFoldCode` and install.

## Usage
Once installed, AutoFoldCode will automatically begin persisting code folds. To clear AutoFoldCode's cache, use the `AutoFoldCode: Clear` command from the Command Palette.
